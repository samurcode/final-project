          In the waning years of the nineteenth century, when the world still
          bore the weight of empires and the shadow of great wars yet to come,
          there was born in the land of Bloemfontein, in the distant South
          African dominion, a child of fate and lore—John Ronald Reuel Tolkien.
          Orphaned young and reared in the gentle hills of England, he found
          solace beneath the whispering trees and among books where ancient
          tongues slumbered. Even in his youth, he was drawn to the echo of
          forgotten ages, crafting alphabets and tales as though some ancient
          spirit stirred in his blood, bidding him recall the elder days of the
          world.

          When the great fires of the First World War were kindled, Tolkien took
          up arms like many of his kin, and amidst the smoke-choked trenches of
          the Somme, he beheld both the ruin and the resilience of the mortal
          heart. It was there, beneath mud-streaked skies and over blasted
          fields, that seeds of his mythopoeia were sown—fragments of light
          against a backdrop of unrelenting shadow. From the despair of that
          time grew hope, and from hope, he began to shape a legendarium, rooted
          in sorrow but reaching for the stars, as if to mend with story what
          war had broken.

          In the days of peace that followed, he toiled as a scholar at Oxford,
          a keeper of ancient tongues and a lover of lore. There, he penned The
          Hobbit, first as a tale for his children, not knowing it would open
          the gates to Middle-earth for all the world. From this humble
          beginning arose The Lord of the Rings, a saga of high deeds and noble
          hearts, of the One Ring and the Fellowship that bore it. Long did he
          labor on its making, for he sought not merely a tale but a world
          entire, with histories deep and languages born from the roots of
          imagination. It was not mere fiction he wrought, but myth reborn in
          the tongue of the modern world.

          So passed the life of the loremaster, who in his final years saw his
          works beloved across the realms of Men. Yet though John Ronald Reuel
          Tolkien laid down his pen in the year of grace 1973, his voice echoes
          still through the leaves of Lórien and in the songs sung beneath the
          stars. He was as one of the Elves, preserving light in darkening days,
          a herald of old beauty and enduring truth. And it is said, among those
          who read him with true heart, that Tolkien did not so much invent
          Middle-earth as remember it—and bid us remember too.
